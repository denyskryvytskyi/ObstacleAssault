# ObstacleAssault
This is a 3D platformer game created in Unreal Engine 5 as part of the [Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ & Make Video Games course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/).
The game features a level with different moving and rotating platforms and objects that the player must use to reach the goal.

Here are some specific things I learned while making this game:

- How to create a C++ class in Unreal Engine and add editable properties to it.
- How to inherit from a C++ class and create a Blueprint based on that.
- How to call C++ functions from Blueprints and pass data between them.
- How to use GameMode to define the rules of the game.
